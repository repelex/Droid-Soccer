\subsection{Detailed Description}
Simple script that uses a property to sync a start time for a multiplayer game. 

When entering a room, the first player will store the synchronized timestamp. You can\textquotesingle{}t set the room\textquotesingle{}s synchronized time in Create\+Room, because the clock on the Master Server and those on the Game Servers are not in sync. We use many servers and each has it\textquotesingle{}s own timer.

Everyone else will join the room and check the property to calculate how much time passed since start. You can start a new round whenever you like.

Based on this, you should be able to implement a synchronized timer for turns between players.

In theory, the client which created the room might crash/close before it sets the start time. Just to make extremely sure this never happens, a new master\+Client will check if it has to start a new round. \index{In\+Room\+Round\+Timer@{In\+Room\+Round\+Timer}!On\+Photon\+Custom\+Room\+Properties\+Changed@{On\+Photon\+Custom\+Room\+Properties\+Changed}}
