This class helps you to synchronize the velocities of a 2d physics Rigid\+Body.  




Inherits Mono\+Behaviour.



\subsection{Detailed Description}
This class helps you to synchronize the velocities of a 2d physics Rigid\+Body. 

Note that only the velocities are synchronized and because Unitys physics engine is not deterministic (ie. the results aren\textquotesingle{}t always the same on all computers) -\/ the actual positions of the objects may go out of sync. If you want to have the position of this object the same on all clients, you should also add a \hyperlink{class_photon_transform_view}{Photon\+Transform\+View} to synchronize the position. Simply add the component to your Game\+Object and make sure that the \hyperlink{class_photon_rigidbody2_d_view}{Photon\+Rigidbody2\+D\+View} is added to the list of observed components
