The room\textquotesingle{}s custom properties to set. 

Use string keys!

Custom room properties are any key-\/values you need to define the game\textquotesingle{}s setup. The shorter your keys are, the better. Example\+: Map, Mode (could be \char`\"{}m\char`\"{} when used with \char`\"{}\+Map\char`\"{}), Tile\+Set (could be \char`\"{}t\char`\"{}). \index{Room\+Options@{Room\+Options}!custom\+Room\+Properties\+For\+Lobby@{custom\+Room\+Properties\+For\+Lobby}}

Defines the custom room properties that get listed in the lobby. 

Name the custom room properties that should be available to clients that are in a lobby. Use with care. Unless a custom property is essential for matchmaking or user info, it should not be sent to the lobby, which causes traffic and delays for clients in the lobby.

Default\+: No custom properties are sent to the lobby. \index{Room\+Options@{Room\+Options}!max\+Players@{max\+Players}}

Max number of players that can be in the room at any time. 0 means \char`\"{}no limit\char`\"{}.

Time To Live (T\+TL) for an \textquotesingle{}actor\textquotesingle{} in a room. If a client disconnects, this actor is inactive first and removed after this timeout. In milliseconds.

Time To Live (T\+TL) for a room when the last player leaves. Keeps room in memory for case a player re-\/joins soon. In milliseconds.

Time To Live (T\+TL) for a room when the last player leaves. Keeps room in memory for case a player re-\/joins soon. In milliseconds.

Removes a user\textquotesingle{}s events and properties from the room when a user leaves.

This makes sense when in rooms where players can\textquotesingle{}t place items in the room and just vanish entirely. When you disable this, the event history can become too long to load if the room stays in use indefinitely. Default\+: true. Cleans up the cache and props of leaving users. \index{Room\+Options@{Room\+Options}!is\+Open@{is\+Open}}

Defines if this room can be joined at all. 

If a room is closed, no player can join this. As example this makes sense when 3 of 4 possible players start their gameplay early and don\textquotesingle{}t want anyone to join during the game. The room can still be listed in the lobby (set is\+Visible to control lobby-\/visibility). \index{Room\+Options@{Room\+Options}!is\+Visible@{is\+Visible}}

Defines if this room is listed in the lobby. 

If not, it also is not joined randomly.

A room that is not visible will be excluded from the room lists that are sent to the clients in lobbies. An invisible room can be joined by name but is excluded from random matchmaking.

Use this to \char`\"{}hide\char`\"{} a room and simulate \char`\"{}private rooms\char`\"{}. Players can exchange a roomname and create it invisble to avoid anyone else joining it. \index{Room\+Options@{Room\+Options}!suppress\+Room\+Events@{suppress\+Room\+Events}}

Tells the server to skip room events for joining and leaving players. 

Using this makes the client unaware of the other players in a room. That can save some traffic if you have some server logic that updates players but it can also limit the client\textquotesingle{}s usability.

P\+UN will break if you use this, so it\textquotesingle{}s not settable.
